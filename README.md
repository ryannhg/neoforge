> A NodeJS wrapper around Neo4J.


### Overview

I just started playing around with [Neo4J](https://www.neo4j.com) last weekend, and I think it's awesome!

I wanted to get some practice writing a NodeJS API, and I thought this would be a fun experiment.


### Running the Demo

There's a local `docker-compose` file that will spin up a Neo4J database for you, in case you don't have one running locally.

1. __`docker-compose up -d`__

1. __`npm install`__

1. __`npm run example`__
